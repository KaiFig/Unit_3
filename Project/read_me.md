# Unit 3 project

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
My client is an ISAK student who enjoys watching and playing footabll a lot. However, after he watches the game, he has no way of keeping a track record of it and it is tedious to have to look up the scores online. Additionally, the sources online do not hold all of the football matches he watches as he watches local teams that are not found on the internet.  

## Proposed Solution
My proposed solution is to create a mobile app that enables my client to record these details by themselves. As it is saved on the app, the client would not have to look the games up using the internet. Additonally, the client will be able to record all the games that he wants, even those that are not found on the internet. This will enable the client to upload their own scores, with no reliance on internet sources, to produce the record that he wants. 

**Design statement:**
I will design and make a mobile app for a client who is very invested in footbal. The mobile app will eneable the client to build a digital record of the games he has seen or played in. It will be constructed using the software python, kivy for the webpage, and sql to create a database. It will take around 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria A, B, C, and D.
